lets write up a prompt for claude code to set this up. id like us to use nut.js, a simple mcp server that wires up to the nut.js functionality, and anthropic for the API key needed. also, we will want to voice control this whole thing, and have the LLM take onscreen actions. we should have some sort of on/off switch for LLM control (ie, we can take it back at any time, not matter what) that is accessible at all times (screen-visible or via hotkey). the process that we spin up should handle mcp client and mcp server locally, and for now we'll use claude to power the LLM portion. we should be sure to write it in such a way that the provider can be easily swapped out. while the process is running, we should be able to naturally speak, and after a brief pause, we convert speech to text, and then send off to the LLM for response, which can then request tool usage through the MCP server, which can then directly control our computer. my hope here is that we can just send a single screenshot to the LLM for it to reason tool usage. ideally, it would be able to pick out tools that do a discrete action, and we code the details on our end. so like "open chrome" would involve several automated steps via nut, but the llm wouldn't need to consider those steps. we want the llm thinking at a human-type level for interactions. we also need to be set up in way the LLM can batch select methods to perform in order: open chrome -> go to google.com -> search for cats -> return control to user. the real goal of the UX here is that the user signals their intent (and i said voice earlier but we should have a typing option as well, some persistent window that can z-index on top of everything when needed), and the LLM enacts just enough steps via the MCP to speed through to their intended destination. imagine i say "lets see what the weather is like in florida today" and there are no open panes in the current GUI. maybe we provide a tool for the llm to call to ask "are there any minimized windows, if so what are they" and if there are none, it then chooses to open chrome, go to weather.com, serach for florida in the weather.com search and then return to the user, since at that point we will be at the information destination point that the user intended.
